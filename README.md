Description

I started coding my assignment with the star background. I used an array that created each star and allowed a star to be repositioned in a new place once it has moved off the screen in warp speed. I then created the base of the ship and spaced out all the buttons and dials. I then added the details like the measurements on the ammunition and fuel levels, the coordinates on the compass and the speeds on the speedometer. Once all the buttons and dials of the ship appeared on the screen I started working on their functionality. I started with the buttons so that when the key corresponding to a button is pressed the button on the screen is filled black and the writing is changed to white, to imitate a pressed button. I also got the compass to move left or right depending on the direction the aimer was moving. Next I got the aimer to move, when one of the directional arrows is pressed, in the same direction. I also made the aimer wrap around when it reached the far left or far right of the screen. Next I did the accelerator functionality. When the A key is pressed the background of space is changed from black to blue to imitate warp speed. When the A key is pressed and it goes into warp speed the fuel level goes down. When the warp speed is stopped the level of fuel rises again. Also when in warp speed the speedometer turns until warp speed is stopped. When the spacebar is pressed the laser is shot from the ship to the aimer. Also when the spacebar is pressed the ammunition level goes down. I then got the ship to power off and all the dials and buttons to stop working while the ship is powered off. With the radar I also got it to move when the ship is on and to stop moving when the ship is off. I also had the little circles in the radar, that represent other planets, to move when the arrow keys or the accelerator is pressed.

Im most proud of the compass part of my project. Im most proud of this functionality because I found it the most difficult to get working. Im also proud of the background of the stars as I think the stars make the project slightly more realistic.
